            of the gift box.</p>

        <p>🎁 If you’d like to give us something, just look for the gift desk in the <strong>lobby of the main

        <h3>🍽️ Reception Food – Buffet (Vegetarian/Vegan Options Available)</h3>

        <p>For the wedding reception, we’ll be serving a buffet-style meal. The menu is already pre-set, but we’ve done our best to include as many vegetarian-friendly options as possible.</p>

        <p>🥗 The food will be a mix of Korean and Western dishes, including salads, rice, and a variety of vegetable-based side dishes.</p>

        <p>However, please note that some Korean dishes may contain fish-based sauces or broths (like anchovy or seafood stock), which are traditionally used in many recipes.</p>

        <p>🌿 While we’ve tried to be mindful of dietary preferences, we sincerely ask for your understanding that we may not be able to accommodate all vegan or vegetarian needs perfectly due to local food customs and venue limitations.
        </p>

        <p>🌿 If you are vegan, we will order vegan food for you in advance. Make sure to check your dietary option in the RSVP form.</p>

        <p>Thank you so much for your understanding — we hope you enjoy the meal and the celebration! 💛</p>

        <h3>🎁 What to Give as Gifts</h3>
        <p>In Korean weddings, instead of bringing physical gifts, guests usually give “축의금” (chug-ui-geum) — a monetary gift in an envelope. This is a traditional way to congratulate the couple and help with wedding expenses.
        </p>
        <p>💌 That said, your presence alone means the world to us — especially since many of you are coming from far away. Gifts are absolutely not required. But if you really wish to give something, we will gratefully accept
            <strong>Chukeuiguem 축의금</strong> (cash gifts).</p>
        <p>💸 <strong>How much is usually given?</strong><br> To help avoid confusion, here’s a common guideline in Korea:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>₩50,000 KRW (~35 EUR or USD): for acquaintances or casual guests</li>
            <li>₩100,000 KRW (~70 EUR or USD): for friends or colleagues</li>
            <li>₩200,000 KRW and up: for close friends or family</li>
        </ul>

        <p>🧧 At the wedding entrance, you’ll find a table for gifts if you’d like to give us something.</p>

        <p>Thank you for celebrating with us — your love and support is the greatest gift of all! 💛</p>

        <h3>🎉 After the Wedding</h3>

        <p>While wedding after-parties aren't really a tradition in Korea, we didn’t want the celebration to end too soon—so we’re planning a casual get-together in the evening to wind down with some drinks and great conversation. 🍻✨</p>

        <p>The details aren’t finalized yet, but we're thinking of heading to a pub nearby your hotel for a relaxed night out. Nothing fancy or formal—just a chance to hang out, laugh, and toast the day together.</p>

        <p>It’s totally optional—we know some of you might be tired after a full day—but if you’re up for it, we’d love for you to join us. Who knows, we might even end the night at a Korean karaoke (aka Noraebang)! 🎤🎶</p>

        <p><em>More info to come soon!</em></p>

        <h3>💳 Money & Payments in Korea</h3>

        <p>In Korea, credit and debit cards are widely accepted in most places — restaurants, cafes, shops, and public transport. You can rely on your card for most of your spending.</p>

        <p>However, for street food stalls, markets, and small vendors, cash is often preferred, so it's a good idea to have some Korean Won (₩) on hand.</p>

        <p><strong>💶 Bringing EUR or Dollars?</strong><br> You can bring EUR or Dollars (€) and easily exchange them at the airport.<br><br> We actually recommend doing your exchange at the airport, because the exchange counters there are run by official
            Korean banks, not private companies — so the process is safe, transparent, and commonly used by locals too.<br><br> If you end up spending your cash too fast, then just visit any of the bank branches in Korea. Or you can also just withdraw
            money at the ATM (fees may apply).</p>

        <p><strong>💡 How much cash should you bring?</strong><br> For things like street snacks, local treats, and small expenses, we suggest bringing about €200 per person in cash, which should be enough for a 2-week stay in Korea.<br><br> For everything
            else, your credit card will work just fine!</p>

        <h3>🚄 Traveling to Other Cities in Korea</h3>

        <p>Exploring beyond Seoul is convenient and efficient, thanks to Korea's well-developed transportation network.</p>

        <p><strong>🚄 KTX (Korea Train Express)</strong><br> The KTX high-speed trains connect major cities such as Busan, Gyeongju, Daegu, and Daejeon. They offer a fast, comfortable, and scenic way to travel across the country.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Booking Tickets:</strong> Tickets can be purchased up to a month in advance through the <a href="https://www.korail.com/global/eng/main" target="_blank">KORAIL Official Website</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>Departure Stations:</strong> In Seoul, KTX trains depart from Seoul Station and Yongsan Station.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>🚌 Express & Intercity Buses</strong><br> Buses provide a cost-effective and comfortable means to reach various destinations, including smaller towns not served by the KTX.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Major Terminals in Seoul:</strong><br>
                <ul>

                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Booking Tickets:</strong><br>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Express Buses:</strong> Tickets can be booked via the <a href="https://www.kobus.co.kr/main.do" target="_blank">KOBUS website</a>.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p><em>*Sometimes, booking tickets online might not work because you don't have a Korean ID or phone number. If that happens, feel free to ask us for help!</em></p>
